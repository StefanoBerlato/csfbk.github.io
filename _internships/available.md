    <ol class="mt-0">
        <li><b>Application</b>: apply to the internship projects you are interested in (up to 3) through the online form related to the specific call, by providing the requested data. Ensure you comply with the application deadline.</li>
        <li><b>Selection</b>: a selection committee reviews the applications for every project and, if needed, asks for an interview.</li>
        <li><b>Results</b>: after the selection process, all the applicants (also those who have not been selected) are informed of the selection results. Please note that the selection process is performed gradually; this means that acceptance notifications for some projects could be sent before others. In any case, each applicant will receive a notification (either of acceptance or rejection) by the end of the procedure.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For general information, you can write an email to <b><a href="mailto:internships-cs@fbk.eu">internships-cs@fbk.eu</a></b>; please note that applications sent via email will <u>not</u> be taken into consideration.</p>
